GPU computing
high memory bandwidth, great for PDEs
Threading helps run parallel loops, massive acceleration of separate tasks
more on performance next week
limiter on stencil codes is memory bandwidth typically (24 bytes of memory for 2 flops in a derivative).
flops isn't the modern limiter. (GPUs are TFlop/s, Gb/s so you can see memory boundedness of this)
Being conservative with memory is key to performant code (matrix methods are bad at this)

Programing GPUs CUDA

building blocks  of: thread, block, grid
1 thread per core roughly, this isn't quite true, but close enough.
